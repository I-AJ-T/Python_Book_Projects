### Numbers ###

2 + 3 
5

3 - 2
1 

2 * 3
6 

3 / 2 
1.5

3**2 
# This is the syntax for a exponent 
9 

2 + 3 * 4 
#Python supports the order of operations 
14 


(2 + 3) * 4
# Parentheses can modify the order of operations 

### Floats ###

0.1 + 0.1 
0.2 

2 * 0.1 
0.2 

### Integers and Floats ###

4 / 2 
2.0 
# Dividing numbers even if it makes a whole number will result in a float number 

1 + 2.0 
1.2 
# Combining integers and floats result in a float 

### Underscores in numbers ###

universe_age = 14_000_000_000 
# Can group numbers with underscores to make the more readable 
print(universe_age)
# Python will read the number with underscores without it 

### Multiple Assignments ### 

x, y, z = 0, 1, 2 
print(f"{x, y, z}")
# Separate the variables by commas to do multiple assignments on one line 

### Constants ### 

MAX_CONNECTIONS = 5000 
# Constants are variables whose value stays the same throughout the life of a program 
# Programmers use all caps to indicate a variable should be treated as a constant 

### The Zen of Python ###

# This will output a brief set of principles for writing good Python code
